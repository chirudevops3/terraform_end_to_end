Type Restrictions for Variables
In Terraform, variables can have their types constrained through the specification of a type argument within the variable declaration block. This mechanism ensures that only values matching the declared type can be assigned to the variable. In the absence of a type constraint, variables are capable of accepting values of any type.

Although not mandatory, it is advisable to define type constraints for several reasons:

They act as clear indicators to module users about the expected data types.
They enable Terraform to generate informative error messages when an incorrect type is provided.
Type constraints can be defined using a combination of basic type keywords and more advanced type constructors. Here are the fundamental type keywords recognized by Terraform:

string
number
bool
For more complex data structures, Terraform supports the following type constructors:

list(<TYPE>): Defines a list containing elements of a specific type.
set(<TYPE>): Specifies a set of unique elements of a particular type.
map(<TYPE>): Denotes a map where all values share the same type.
object({<ATTR NAME> = <TYPE>, ... }): Represents an object with attributes of specified types.
tuple([<TYPE>, ...]): Indicates a tuple with elements of potentially different types.
By leveraging these type constraints, you can ensure that your Terraform configurations are more robust and easier to understand for other users.
